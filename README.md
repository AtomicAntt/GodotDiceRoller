# Godot Dice Roller
Quick dice roller application I created in ~3 hours where you are able to throw bouncy 2D dice around a dungeon room.

Made with Godot Engine v4.1.2

# Building and Running the game

First, install the Godot game engine (4.1.2) [here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.1.2-stable/)

Next, run the following command to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/AtomicAntt/GodotDiceRoller
```

Finally, open up the Godot Engine project manager, click the Import button, and choose the 'project.godot' file from the files downloaded.
